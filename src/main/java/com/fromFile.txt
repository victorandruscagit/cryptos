Guy Lacombe, Zidane’s mentor and former coach said that, “What Zidane did already have was the sense of the collective. He made other players play well. He used to solve problems on the pitch intuitively because he was so good, but he also got the best out of his less talented teammates. Now he needs more than intuition, but he has this intimate skill to feel the collective thinking of the team. He has always understood other players.”

Zidane’s philosophy was clear. He said, “I want my team to play, spread the ball, build from the back and keep possession”. But, for your setup to work with maximum efficiency, you need the right profiles and sometimes you don’t get those players. How the coach adapts then, is the true definition of a master tactician and Zidane showed signs of that from his Castilla days.

    Zidane then decided to switch from a possession-based setup to a more direct, more efficient setup that would work best with the players he had. Switching to a direct 4-2-3-1 was a masterstroke as Castilla went on to collect 37 out of 48 points from the remaining fixtures post-October.



    Rafa Benitez has just been sacked by Real Madrid, 6 months after appointing him as head coach in the summer. Zinedine Zidane was promoted from Castilla to replace Benitez as head coach. People were surprised at first when Zidane was given the head coach role because you don’t expect a club like Real Madrid to appoint a coach with zero first division experience.



    Zidane had been working since 2013 for this moment and attending Pep Guardiola’s training sessions at Bayern, Marcelo Bielsa’s coaching seminars and working on his UEFA Pro License. In his first press conference, Zidane emphasized introducing an ‘attractive attacking style’ with possession and speed as the main principles of his team. He prioritized ball retention more than anything and for that, you need to get your ideas across to the players very carefully.
